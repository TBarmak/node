# Project 1
Welcome to the first project! We'll take things easy, since this is just our first for the semester.

## Description
Use what you've learned to answer questions about a live, impactful dataset. We've already pulled out a few data sources and kept them in [data.md](data.md), but if you have another dataset in mind, go for it!

- Come up with questions about the data: What trends exist? Does that contradict what we'd expect? What are some key takeaways we can pull from the data?
- Use what you've learned from pandas to write a Python notebook: Be sure to annotate the code as you go along

## Deliverable
- A Jupyter notebook ready-to-go with annotations in markdown cells or comments, available to view w/o any setup.
  - Check out [https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/) for displaying as webapges
- Slack me or your PC the link before next workshop!

## Collaboration
You'll be working either with partners or individually, but collaboration with your lab group is defintely encouragedâ€“ help each other out!
