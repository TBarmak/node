    "\n",
    "<br>In the real world, data comes from databases. Each transaction gets recorded as a observation, what item was purchased, at which store, by which customer. We can refer to these items by name, but there can be confusion if there's overlap. (i.e. Two customers with the same name, or two products with the same name)\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>Instead, we can assign **unique identifiers** to each item, store, customer. Even if they have the same name, they'll be distinct in the eyes of the data. Since these are randomly assigned, they can look pretty ugly, but just know that **each ID is associated just one thing**"

    "**Why we're using GroupBys**:\n",
    "\n",
    "<br> Sometimes information in observations can be duplicated. Each row is a item that was purchased by some customer, on some day, at some store. That customer could have purchased *multiple items* in that transaction. To show that, we give each observation from the same transaction the *same OrderID*.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br> This means that if we wanted some information at the transaction level, i.e. how many items were purchased per transaction, we could **first groupby each OrderID**, and then get some summary statistic, i.e 'count' to capture how many items are in each order.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br> Now we have data where each row is a different order. To get the average number of items purchased per transaction, we now **average the grouped data**, and come up with a single number that summarizes that series. "
