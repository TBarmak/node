# Week 2: Pandas!
## Workshop 
Today we'll be working with IMDB movie data. We'll cover the fundamentals of working `pandas` objects, including groupby, subsetting & filtering, as well as chaining multiple methods together

    2. Save these to the **same** directory on your hard disk
    3. Open up Anaconda, navigate to the directory, and everything should be good to go

**If that doesn't work**, go ahead and follow this week's link through Google Colab
- Open up [INSERT COLAB LINK](INSERT COLAB LINK) 
    1. Sign into your Google account
