# Project Part 1: Scoping

Imagine you've been hired at a top data consulting firm. They are a new group that tackles contemporary issues from an analytical angle. Sometimes there are clients, but oftentimes the team publishes with the intention of releasing their findings into the public domain. As a new analyst, you've been given free reign to *define a project of your choosing*. You can either find a project from a real client (friend, work, etc.), a government dataset, or public use file from a corporate source.  

Before setting sail on your project, however, the director must approve your plan of action. This document is incredibly important as it sets the *scope* of the project. No surprise, we call it the **scoping document**. Everything from how the data will be collected to  what kinds of conclusions you're hoping to draw should be described. 

## Deliverable: The Scoping Document

We'll use the following structure adapted from the [Center for Data Science and Public Policy](http://www.datasciencepublicpolicy.org/home/resources/data-science-project-scoping-guide/) at the University of Chicago. We expect 4 brief sections that outline your thoughts on the following:

- *Goals* – Define the goal(s) of the project. What questions are you hoping to answer?
- *Data Collection* – What data do you need to answer your questions? What data do you have access to?
- *Analysis* – What patterns would you hope to show? How will you describe the data? Are there any columns that can be predicted?
- *Ethical Considerations* – How can this project support inclusion and equality? Are there similar cases, either historical or ongoing? How did these projects navigate the ethical issues around data collection or usage?

Submit a ***PDF document*** to Ishaan via Slack no later than ***Sunday, September 19th*** at 3pm. 

Any questions? Let Daniel or I know on Slack! We're more than happy to help.
