# Project 2
## Description
Our goal is to tackle some of the biggest problems in 2020 using exploratory data analysis. We've compiled a list of potential, but by no means exhaustive set of datasets from various sources, ranging from federal to local government, small non-profit organizations to the New York Stock Exchange. 

Your goals:

- Come up with **questions** about the data: What trends exist? Does that contradict what we'd expect? What are some key takeaways we can pull from the data?
- **Explore** your data! Try statistics and numerical insights, and build visualizations that describe the trends you see
- **Document** your code! Use comments, markdown cells, anything to make a self-supported analysis of the data and the outcome

## Deliverable
- At least *one visualization* per team member
- A Jupyter notebook ready-to-go with annotations in markdown cells or comments
  - Check out [https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/) for displaying notebooks as clean webapges
- Use of GitHub is *encouraged*, but not required!
- Slack your instructor the link before next workshop!

## Data
The datasets we've found are [linked on GitHub](https://github.com/ishaandey/node/tree/master/projects/project-2). In most cases you'll need to download the data yourself using the link provided.
