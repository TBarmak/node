# Project 3
## Description
Our goal is to tackle some of the biggest problems in 2020 using machine learning. We've compiled a list of potential, but by no means exhaustive set of datasets from various sources, ranging from federal to local government, small non-profit organizations to the New York Stock Exchange. 

Your goals:

- **Predict** a target variable of interest from your dataset
- **Document** your code! Use comments, markdown cells, anything to make a self-supported analysis of the data and the outcome

## Deliverable
- Work together to: (1) Do basic EDA, (2) Preprocess the data, (3) Create a ML model, (4) Evaluate the model performance
- A Jupyter notebook ready-to-go with annotations in markdown cells or comments
  - Check out [nbviewer.jupyter.org](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/) for displaying notebooks as clean webapges
- Use of GitHub is *encouraged*, but not required!
- Slack your instructor the link before next workshop!

## Data
The datasets we've found are [linked on GitHub](https://github.com/ishaandey/node/tree/master/projects/project-2). In most cases you'll need to download the data yourself using the link provided.
<br>Feel free to explore other datasets outside of the ones we've linked, good sources include [data.gov](https://www.data.gov/) or [kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets).

Feel free to use *different datasets* from the previous project if you'd like.
