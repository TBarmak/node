# Lab 6: Google's AI-Powered App

### Goal

We will be exploring Google's debut app that can diagnose skin conditions based on photos of the consumer's skin. It's fairly new and could potentially help a bunch of people that could be walking around with harmful skin conditions. This example of a real world use of a ML classification model highlights the ways certain companies are utilizing machine learning.

### Your Task

After reading the article and by **using your knowledge of ML**, tackle the following questions under a group discussion:

- If you were at Google, what kind of data would you need to even train the model?
- How would you validate the model?
- What might be some problems of a dataset with the following pictures (besides not enough data)?
