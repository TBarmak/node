# Lab 6: Google's AI-Powered App

### Goal

We will be exploring Google's debut app that can diagnose skin conditions based on photos of the consumer's skin. It's fairly new and could potentially help a bunch of people that could be walking around with harmful skin conditions. This example of a real world use of a ML classification model highlights the ways certain companies are utilizing machine learning.

### Your Task

After reading the article and by **using your knowledge of how machine learning models are trained**, tackle the following questions under a group discussion:

1. If you were at Google, what kind of data would you need to train the model?
2. How would you validate the model? Be specific - how big would the project be, who would you need to recruit, etc.?
3. What might be some problems of a dataset with the following pictures (besides not enough data)?

4. How could we prevent the problem(s) of a dataset similar to the one above? Hint: It's not *just* about the training data

- Supervised, classification model
- Put labels on there first, group them
- Identify the groups, need the training data and testing data
- Lots of pictures of things that are moles/skin conditions and those that aren't
- Getting data pertaining to individuals --> skin color, race, gender/sex

- If testing, release it beta testers --> validate through them as they meet with their doctor/dermatologist
- Doing biopsies, different scans they can do --> having that data/technology

- skin tone is only white, not diverse

- avoiding mistakes in the model: more information awareness, consult a doctor, don't take results to heart
- obviously, get more data, but easier said than done. loading more data on diverse skin colors and tones
