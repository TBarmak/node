# Node
Welcome! Node is a ten week introductory data science course offered by [HackCville](https://hackcville.com/), where students pick up **core data literacy skills** necessary to tackle questions of their own. 

Among other things, we'll learn the foundations of data manipulation, exploratory data analysis, machine learning, and apply them towards our own areas of interests in projects. Though the course assumes some basic knowledge of programming or familiarity with Python, all are welcome.

By the end of this course, our goal is to show what's possible by learning data scienceâ€“ how to ask the right questions, critique models, and cut through the noise to help you find the patterns in your work. Ultimately, we'd like students to leave with enough familiarity of Python to be independent analysts in their own fields, as well as understand how data science is increasingly used in the world around them.

## Course Details 
All weeks will comprise of (1) a lesson delivered through **workshops**, typically as a Jupyter Notebook, (2) supplemental practice to be completed during **labs**, (3) links to further exploration or example **applications**, and (4) relevant **memes**. 

### Course Materials
All course material (slides, notebooks, datasets, etc.) will live in [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/ishaandey/node). For ease of access, we've setup a mirror at [files.node.ishaandey.com](https://files.node.ishaandey.com/) that'll allow you to individually download files to your local computer
