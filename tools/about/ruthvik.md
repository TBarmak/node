What's up everyone! My name is Ruthvik and I'm a second year at UVA studying CS and Stats in the glorious e-school. I love going fishing and playing any sport in my free time, but I also love lounging around and watching netflix. I'm really interested in machine learning and artificial intelligence, so feel free to reach out to me at **rrg5kq@virginia.edu** so we can talk about our interests! Get ready for an exciting semester at Node!
