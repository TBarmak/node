Hey guys! My name is Ben and I'm a second year at UVA studying computer science and economics. I'm a **MASSIVE** sports fan and I'm fascinated by the ability to tell the stories behind the games I love through data. In my free time I enjoy playing soccer, making yogurt parfaits, and watching stand-up comedy. Feel free to reach me at **ben.humleker@gmail.com**, I'd love to chat or help with any questions you have!
