### Node Program Lead
Hi! My name is Ishaan, I'm third year at the University of Virginia studying statistics & economics, and hopefully medicine. Why? Whether its about creating care programs around patient needs, or understanding why AI predicts the medical outcomes it does, I'd like to help make *data work for people*. Other than that, I love photography, cooking, and a huge Baltimore Ravens fan. Feel free to reach out with any questions, or just say hi! You can find me at **ishaan@hackcville.com**. 

### Program Coordinators
TBD Fall 2020

### Contributors
This course would not have been possible without the support of HackCville's amazing staff. Big shoutouts to Christian Jung and Ben Artuso for crafting previous iterations of this course, and for the team's feedback and continued support.
