### Program Lead
#### Ishaan Dey
Hey there! My name is Ishaan, I'm third year at the University of Virginia studying statistics & economics, and hopefully medicine. he common denominator across my interests: making healthcare work for people. Whether it’s genomic sequences or financial outcomes, I’m interested in leveraging data to make care accessible and affordable. At the end of the day, I'd like to help make *data work for people*. Outside of school, I love photography, cooking, rooting for the Baltimore Ravens. Feel free to reach out with any questions, or just say hi! You can find me by email at **ishaan@hackcville.com** or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ishaan-dey/).

### Program Coordinators
#### Ben Humleker
Hey guys! My name is Ben and I'm a second year at UVA studying computer science and economics. I'm a *MASSIVE* sports fan and I'm fascinated by the ability to tell the stories behind the games I love through data. In my free time I enjoy playing soccer, making yogurt parfaits, and watching stand-up comedy. Feel free to reach me at **ben.humleker@gmail.com**, I'd love to chat or help with any questions you have!

#### Ruthvik Gajjala
What's up everyone! My name is Ruthvik and I'm a second year at UVA studying CS and Stats in the glorious e-school. I love going fishing and playing any sport in my free time, but I also love lounging around and watching netflix. I'm really interested in machine learning and artificial intelligence, so feel free to reach out to me at **rrg5kq@virginia.edu** so we can talk about our interests! Get ready for an exciting semester at Node!
