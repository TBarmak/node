### Program Lead
#### Ishaan Dey
Hey there! My name is Ishaan, I'm third year at the University of Virginia studying statistics & economics, and hopefully medicine. The common denominator across my interests: making healthcare work for people. Whether it’s genomic sequences or financial outcomes, I’m interested in leveraging data to make care accessible and affordable. This is my 5th semester at Forge, having started as a student in Launch, and now starting my second semester as the Node Program Lead. Outside of school, I love photography, cooking, and rooting for the Baltimore Ravens. Feel free to reach out with any questions, or just say hi! You can find me by email at **ishaan@joinforge.co** or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ishaan-dey/).

### Program Coordinators
#### Brittany Nguyen
Hi everyone! My name is Brittany and I am a third year at UVA majoring in Statistics. I cannot wait to meet and work alongside each of you this semester. I am most interested in machine learning models and data visualization, and their unique ability to tell stories in practically every aspect of life! Outside of class and Forge, you can find me playing tennis, guitar, or the piano. Feel free to email me anytime at **bhn4bf@virginia.edu**. Wahoowa!

#### Taylor Barback
Hey guys! My name is Taylor, and I am a third year at the University of Virginia studying Computer Science and Commerce. I am obsessed with the reality TV show Survivor, and love analyzing any dataset related to it. In my free time, I enjoy swimming, reading, and playing chess. I am fascinated by NLP and applying data science to investment opportunities. Feel free to reach out to me at **twb4tr@virginia.edu** with any questions, or just to chat! I hope you have as much fun with Node as I did!
