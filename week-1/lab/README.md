# Lab 1

## Setups for the semester! 
Typically, we'll have an open-ended practice activity for you to do, but this week we'll focus on getting all our tools ready-to-go for the semester to come.

### Create a GitHub Account
All our files this semester will be hosted on GitHub, and week 5 we'll learn how to collaborate with code, and make a portfolio of our work.

1. Make a [GitHub Account](https://github.com/join) 
2. Sign up for the [GitHub Student Pack](https://education.github.com/pack) when you get the chance
3. Download [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) to your local machine
4. Feel free to follow us! @ishaandey, @rgajjala18, @benhumleker [![Link](../../tools/buttons/open-github.svg)](https://github.com/ishaandey) 

### Install Anaconda
Anaconda is a toolkit that (among many other things) does the hard work of installing, organizing, and securing all the data science software we'll be using this semester. This'll be an alternative to Google Colab, but it's great to have for working on personal projects.

- Head over to the [installation page](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual)
    1. Scroll down to `Anaconda Installers`
    2. Select the **graphical installer** for your OS, *not the command line installer below it*

### Let us get to know you!
Fill out this [little welcome survey](). This isn't anything formal, we'd just like to get to know you more than just your studies.

### Slack Check
Once you've done each one of these, shoot your instructor a slack DM so we can see you've got everything ready to go!

### What is Data Science?
Check out this [note](what_is_ds.md) on what exactly data science is! It's always great to have broader context on our work.
