    "Imagine you've been commissioned by the City of San Francisco to tackle a problem they've been having with local flora. The parks department has taken extensive documentation of the city's trees since the 1970s - what species are growing, where they are, who they're maintained by - amassing a dataset of over 200K trees in that time. \n",
