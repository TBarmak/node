# Week 1: Workshop

Imagine you've been commissioned by the City of San Francisco to tackle a problem they've been having with local flora. The parks department has taken extensive documentation of the city's trees since the 1970s - what species are growing, where they are, who they're maintained by - amassing a dataset of over 200K trees in that time.

The funding for that project has recently been called into question, and the City Board needs to see its value in reapproving funds for the following year. Stakeholders have raised several concerns over the past few years, and your job is to use the data to answer them. Good luck!
