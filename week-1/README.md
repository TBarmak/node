# Week 1: Welcome to Data Science!

Welcome to Node! We're glad to have you. This week we'll help you get your bearings on what data science really means. Hopefully by the end of the course, you'll each come up with your own interpretation. For now, we'll tackle some hard hitting problems.

## Tasks to complete
### Create a GitHub Account
All our files this semester will be hosted on GitHub. A couple of steps
1. Make a [GitHub account](https://github.com/join) 
2. Sign up for the [GitHub Student Pack](https://education.github.com/pack) when you get the chance
3. Download [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) to your local machine
4. Feel free to follow us: [![Link](../tools/buttons/open-github.svg)](https://github.com/ishaandey)

### Install Anaconda
Anaconda is a toolkit that (among many other things) does the hard work of installing, organizing, and securing all the data science software we'll be using this semester. 

- Head over to the [installation page](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual)
    1. Scroll down to `Anaconda Installers`
    2. Select the **graphical installer** for your OS, *not the command line installer below it*
