Welcome to Node! We're glad to have you. This week we'll help you get your bearings on what data science really means. Hopefully by the end of the course, you'll each come up with your own interpretation. For now, we'll tackle some hard hitting problems. 

## Workshop 
Imagine you've been commissioned by the City of San Francisco to tackle a problem they've been having with local flora. The parks department has taken extensive documentation of the city's trees since the 1970s - what species are growing, where they are, who they're maintained by - amassing a dataset of over 200K trees in that time. 

The funding for that project has recently been called into question, and the City Board needs to see its value in reapproving funds for the following year. Stakeholders have raised several concerns over the past few years, and your job is to use the data to answer them. Good luck!

    1. Sign into a Google account
    2. Click `Open with Google Colaboratory`
    3. (In the notebook) Navigate to `File` > `Open in playground mode`
    4. (Once that loads) Hit `Copy to Drive` to save a copy to your Drive account 

## Lab

### Create a GitHub Account
All our files this semester will be hosted on GitHub, so if you don't have one yet, make a [GitHub account](https://github.com/join) and download GitHub Desktop for your local machine. This should be self explanatory, and make sure to sign up for the [GitHub Student Pack](https://education.github.com/pack) for some awesome perks when you get the chance.  

### Install Anaconda
Anaconda is a toolkit that (among many other things) does the hard work of installing, organizing, and securing all the data science software we'll be using this semester. 

- Head over to the [installation page](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual)
    1. Scroll down to `Anaconda Installers`
    2. Select the **graphical installer** for your OS, *not the command line installer below it*
    3. Follow through with the installation instructions
    4. If all goes well, you should be able to open up Anaconda like this:
