## Lab

### Create a GitHub Account
All our files this semester will be hosted on GitHub, so if you don't have one yet, make a [GitHub account](https://github.com/join) and download GitHub Desktop for your local machine. This should be self explanatory, and make sure to sign up for the [GitHub Student Pack](https://education.github.com/pack) for some awesome perks when you get the chance.  

### Install Anaconda
Anaconda is a toolkit that (among many other things) does the hard work of installing, organizing, and securing all the data science software we'll be using this semester. 

- Head over to the [installation page](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual)
    1. Scroll down to `Anaconda Installers`
    2. Select the **graphical installer** for your OS, *not the command line installer below*
    3. Follow through with the installation instructions
    4. If all goes well, you should be able to open up Anaconda like this:
