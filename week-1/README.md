# Week 1: Welcome to Data Science!

Welcome to Node! We're glad to have you. This week we'll help you get your bearings on what data science really means. Hopefully by the end of the course, you'll each come up with your own interpretation. For now, we'll tackle some hard hitting problems.

## Tasks to complete
### Create a GitHub Account
All our files this semester will be hosted on GitHub, so if you don't have one yet, make a [GitHub account](https://github.com/join) and download GitHub Desktop for your local machine. This should be self explanatory, and make sure to sign up for the [GitHub Student Pack](https://education.github.com/pack) for some awesome perks when you get the chance.  

### Install Anaconda
Anaconda is a toolkit that (among many other things) does the hard work of installing, organizing, and securing all the data science software we'll be using this semester. 

- Head over to the [installation page](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual)
    1. Scroll down to `Anaconda Installers`
    2. Select the **graphical installer** for your OS, *not the command line installer below it*
