# Lab 7: Predict Majors of Node Students

### Goal

Last week we **applied ML concepts** to create a model that predicts whether or not someone is a data major or not.

Today we'll try to understand how that model made its decision.

### Outline

1. Import needed packages
2. Upload the data to Colab like we did last week (using the folder icon on the left)
3. Clean the data
4. Create a random forest classifier model
5. Visualize one of the random forest trees
6. Create a KNN model for k = 1-5
7. Determine which value of k gives the best performance
8. Determine which model works best for our data
