# ML Algorithmns Cheatsheet




## Supervised Learning



### Classification

- **Logistic Regression**
    - Uses maximum likelihood estimation to fit a logistic curve to data
- **KNN**: K-Nearest Neighbors
    - Compare class against K closest neighbors 
- **SVM**: Support Vector Machines
    - Fits a boundary between clusters to maximize the margin
- **DT / RF**: Decision Trees and Random Forest
    - To minimize entropy
- **GBM**: Gradient Boosted Machines
    - 
- **NB**: Naive Bayes


### Regression
- **Linear Regression**
    - 
- **LASSO / Ridge Regression**: Regularization
    - 
- **LOWESS**: Locally Weighted Scatterplot Smoothing
    -

### Clustering
- **K-Means**
    - 
- **DBSCAN**  Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise
    -  

### Dimensionality Reduction
- **PCA** Principal Component Analysis
    - Linear transformation that can compress down data from n to 2 dimensions
    - StatQuest
**tSNE** t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding
    -
