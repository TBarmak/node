# Week 3: Data Cleaning!
Data cleaning is the least glamorous segment of a data scientist's routine, yet easily makes up over 80% of the show.

## Workshop 
Data cleaning is the least glamorous segment of a data scientist's routine, yet easily makes up over 80% of the show. Today, we'll cover our bases in `pandas` by learning how to (1) deal with missing data, (2) create new features using `lambda apply`, and (3) data from several sources. Later in the week, we'll get introduced to handling time series data and text data. 


For today's lab, try to open up today's files using Anaconda
- Head over to [https://files.node.ishaandey.com/](https://files.node.ishaandey.com/)
    1. Click `week-3` and download `cleaning.ipynb` and `??.csv`
    2. Save these to the *same* directory on your hard disk

**If that doesn't work**, go ahead and follow this week's link through Google Colab
- Open up [INSERT COLAB LINK](INSERT COLAB LINK) 
    1. Sign into your Google account
    2. Click `Open with Google Colaboratory`
    3. (In the notebook) Navigate to `File` > `Open in playground mode`
    4. (Once that loads) Hit `Copy to Drive` to save a copy to your Drive account 

## Lab
Work on Project 1 with your team! Check out the description below.

## Project 1
Welcome to the first project! We'll take things easy, since this is just our first for the semester.

### Description
Use what you've learned to answer questions about a live, impactful dataset. We've already pulled out a few data sources and kept them in the `week-3/project-1` directory, but if you have another dataset in mind, go for it!

- Come up with questions about the data: What trends exist? Does that contradict what we'd expect? How does X differ across y? What are some key takeaways we can extract from the data?
- Use what you've learned from pandas to write a Python notebook: Be sure to annotate the code as you go along

### Deliverable
- A Jupyter notebook ready-to-go with annotations in markdown cells or comments, available to view for a user without any setup.
  - Check out [https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/) for one great option for displaying notebooks online
- Slack me or your PC the link before next workshop!

### Collaboration
You'll be working either with partners or individually, but collaboration with your lab group is defintely encouragedâ€“ help each other out!
