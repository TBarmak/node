# Week 3: Data Cleaning!
## Workshop 
Data cleaning is the least glamorous segment of a data scientist's routine, yet easily takes up over 80% of the show. Today, we'll cover our bases in `pandas` by learning how to (1) deal with missing data, (2) create new features using `lambda apply`, and (3) data from several sources. Later in the week, we'll get introduced to handling time series data and text data. 

For today's lab, try to open up today's files using Anaconda
- Head over to [https://files.node.ishaandey.com/](https://files.node.ishaandey.com/)
    1. Click `week-3` and download `cleaning_notes.ipynb`
    2. Open it up using Anaconda navigator
- If you're having issues with Python or code and just wanna follow along:
    - Open up the `cleaning_key.html` page, which should be entirely viewable from browser
