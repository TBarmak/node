# Week 3: Data Cleaning!
## Workshop 
Data cleaning is the least glamorous segment of a data scientist's routine, yet easily takes up over 80% of the show. Today, we'll cover our bases in `pandas` by learning how to (1) deal with missing data, (2) create new features using `lambda apply`, and (3) data from several sources. Later in the week, we'll get introduced to handling time series data and text data.
