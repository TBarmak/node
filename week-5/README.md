# Week 5: DevOps!

## Workshop 
So far in Node we've been living in a bubble. All the projects we've worked on have been by ourselves, without any direct collaboration on code. We've trusted our computers to handle all the software setup, and why not? It's worked just fine. 

But not always. Say we want to process a super large dataset thats just too big for our laptops. We'd want to use the computational resources of a remote server to do the hard work, then just send the output back to our laptops when it's done. For that to work, we've gotta make sure the server is using the same software as we areâ€“ how would we do that?

Or say we're working in a team to build a dashboard that tallies and displays global case counts for an infectious disease. We've got to be able to have access the code for the data cleaning that maybe someone else has written, but if that gets updated, we want to make sure our copy of that script gets updated as well. Too bad there isn't a Google Docs for code... yet.

Clearly, we've got a lot to learn. Though the tools we'll learn will help us work with Python, it won't actually be coded in Python. So, instead of notebooks, we've got a few markdown pages with the instructions for today's activities. 

1. [Bash for Beginners](bash.md)

2. [Guide to Git](git.md)

3. [Environments made Easy](venv.md)


## Lab
5 Word Short Stories! One of the most core concepts of Git is getting the hang of pulling, commiting, then pushing our work. To practice this, we'll partner up and write stories, 5 words at a time.
