## What is AI/ML?
Aside from being *the* buzzword of the decade, machine learning is an incredibly powerful tool that allows us to model situations and predict outcomes.



There's a couple different areas of machine learning, each of which have their own use cases. For now, we'll try to cover the lingo, just to help us think about when we'd use what.
 
## Supervised Learning

### Classification vs. Regression 

## Unsupervised Learning


## Reinforcement Learning
